Called only at the top level of a components.
Don’t call Hook from inside a loop, because it will cause an error. 
Call Hook from inside the function that defines a component. Don’t call Hook from inside another function
(like a render prop). Instead, always unwrap the inputs (props or state) to their most basic form before calling them. You can do this by “destructuring” the props object.
